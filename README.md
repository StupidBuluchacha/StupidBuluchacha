- 👋 Hey, I’m Stupid Buluchacha (yo don't laugh at my github name. Just make it less nerdy >.<)
- 👀 I’m interested in a great range of computer science, from AI (esp. NLP and trustworthy ML) to software engineering (application development is fun as well)
- 🌱 BTW I’m currently pursing my master degree in School of Computing, National University of Singapore (How fortunate I am!)
- 💞️ I’m looking for a better opportunity to enhance myself in the university or industry (Talking about the future huh. Who knows?!)
- 📫 Welcome any comment/feedback/query！
